# YAML Package File Template
# This is a template showing the proper structure for package files
# Copy this structure when creating new package categories
---
packages:
  # Category name (use snake_case)
  category_name:
    - package-name-1
    - package-name-2
    # - commented-package    # This won't be installed
  
  another_category:
    - another-package
  
  # You can have as many categories as you want
  # Categories are just for organization - all packages are installed
  
  # Example categories:
  # browsers:
  #   - googlechrome
  #   - firefox
  # 
  # utilities:
  #   - 7zip.install
  #   - notepadplusplus.install
  
  # Empty categories are OK
  empty_category:
  
# Notes:
# - Empty files are OK and won't cause errors
# - All lines starting with # are comments
# - Use 2 spaces for indentation
# - Package names must start with "- "
# - Categories are optional, you can list packages directly under "packages:"
